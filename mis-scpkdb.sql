The project builds on Save the Children Federation, Inc.’s (SC’s) and consortium partners’ technical CEFM and organizational expertise and links to CSOs and CEFM-related networks. The approach is designed for sustainability and scale as activities focus on strengthening CSO’s capacity, fostering ecosystem improvements for local CSOs and stakeholders, complemented by changes in social norms and advancements in CEFM policy implementation. The project will strengthen CSOs’ ability to address context-specific drivers of CEFM, mobilize communities against the practice, influence key stakeholders to improve CEFM prevention and response including multisectoral services, and link survivors to quality services. It also promotes local leadership and ownership of the project’s goal, objectives, and activities, ensuring sustainability and increased action to address CEFM.\r\n\r\nProject Goal: Grassroots CSOs are supported to engage in and implement high-quality, gender-transformative programming and advocacy that contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of CEFM and increased support for women and girls who experience or are at risk of CEFM.\r\nObjective 1: Mobilize, support, and coordinate grassroots CSOs to prevent and respond to CEFM with synchronized and gender-transformative, community-based approaches.\r\nObjective 2: Increase coordination among CSOs, relevant government authorities, and other key stakeholders to strengthen local leadership and implementation of gender-transformative and effective policies, programs, and advocacy to prevent and respond to CEFM.\r\nThe above objectives will be achieved focusing on supporting, mobilizing and coordinating with local CSOs to respond to CEFM with gender-transformative and community-based approaches. On the other hand, increasing coordination among CSOs, Government authorities and other key stakeholders to implement effective policies and advocacy to prevent CEFM. \r\nEach objective will be achieved through the implementation of a package of activities that contribute to the outcome and output indicators included in the log frame.\r\nThe project aims to strengthen grassroots civil society organizations’ (CSO’s) ability to prevent and respond to child, early, and forced marriage (CEFM) in Pakistan with community-based and high-quality, gender-transformative programming and advocacy. To contribute to this goal, the project will also support the broader ecosystem (e.g., stakeholders, institutions, networks, policies) and CSO’s leadership within it, to accelerate action to reduce the prevalence of CEFM and expand support for survivors and at-risk women and girls. The project will: \r\n1.	Provide financial, organizational, and technical support for 25 local CSO sub-awardees in Pakistan that prevent and respond to CEFM in Naseerabad and Jaffarabad in Balochistan province and Jacobabad and Khairpur districts in Sindh province.\r\n2.	Support at least two (one in each province) CEFM-related CSO networks at the district and provincial levels through sub-awardee participation to enable all CSO members to enhance evidenced-based CEFM programming, coordination, resource sharing, and joint advocacy and synchronize efforts with national- and provincial-level CSO networks.\r\n3.	Strengthen at least two (one in each province) CEFM-related multistakeholder networks of grassroots CSOs, relevant government authorities, and other key stakeholders to promote collaboration on CEFM prevention and response; address harmful gender and social barriers within networks that stifle leadership of historically marginalized groups; engage in joint advocacy, align local through national policy and programming, and disseminate key learnings to support high-quality, gender-transformative programming to end CEFM.\r\n4.	Facilitate the leadership and meaningful participation of marginalized groups (based on gender, age, caste, ethnicity, disability, socio-economic status, religion) within CSOs sub-awardees and the leadership of these groups, along with youth- and women-led CSOs within CEFM-related networks.\r\nMajor activities under Project:\r\n\r\n•	Refine GAP analysis research findings and recommendations with local CSOs and key stakeholders, and refresh CSO landscape analyses to ground project activities in context-specific evidence on CEFM  \r\n•	Launch the ‘Grassroots Action (GAC) Fund to End CEFM’, with country-specific selection criteria and select a diverse range of local CSO sub-awardees  \r\n•	Support CSO sub-awardees to complete Organizational Capacity Assessments and strengthening plans and engage in gender-transformative capacity strengthening  \r\n•	Provide financial, organizational, and technical support for local 25 CSO sub-awardees in Pakistan that prevent and respond to CEFM\r\n•	Strengthen CSO CEFM-related networks and regular cross-learning among CSOs at the district and local level\r\n•	Strengthen multistakeholder networks of CSOs, relevant government authorities, and other key stakeholders and coordinate joint forums on preventing and responding to CEFM\r\n•	Conduct policy review and recommendations workshop with CEFM-related multistakeholder networks \r\n•	Support local, joint advocacy and campaigns by CSOs, government authorities, and other key stakeholders on ending CEFM\r\n•	Disseminate project learnings and evidence to improve provincial and district-level programming on CEFM prevention and response, In conjunction with CSO sub-awardees.\r\n•	Baseline and Endline studies of the project.', '[\"3\",\"4\"]', '[\"178\",\"176\",\"171\",\"168\"]', 47, 0, 55, '2024-05-08 04:32:47', 55, '2024-05-23 09:45:33'),

(9, 'Pakistan ranks 2nd worst in gender parity, with poverty and social protection as persistent challenges[1].  Pakistan also faces high vulnerability to climate-related losses (Climate Risk Index 2021, 8th out of 180 countries) which exacerbate protection issues for children. Girls are one of the most marginalized segments of society, with 12.4 million girls out of school in Sindh, lack of educational opportunities limits prospects and makes girls more vulnerable to risks of child early and forced marriage (CEFM)[2]. SC’s Multi-Sectoral Needs Assessment (2022) identifies that gender norms and discrimination place women and adolescent girls at a heigh risk of CEFM, sexual abuse, exploitation, and harassment[3].  Led by Marvi Rural Development Organization – MRDO, (women-led) will implement this project in Khairpur, Sindh province, where SC has presence and socio-economic issues are high, to address child protection (CP) and climate change (CC) issues faced by children esp. girls by applying SC’s socio-ecological model .In addition to positive impact on children, this locally led project will ensure sustainability by strengthening the capacities of MRDO to lead CP and CC actions at community levels and scale up the efforts of the project beyond SC’s support. This will also contribute to SC’s Global strategy for localization. We will opt and contextualize “Girl Decide” program prior to the inception and actual implementation. The project will ensure girl empowerment and ultimately contribute to help eliminate inequalities. The following outcome and activities will be delivered in 9 months with 1 month inception period at estimated budget of $250,000 reaching out to 3,623 beneficiaries (1,300 Girls, 830 Boys, 60 women and 780 men) including 1,355 indirect beneficiaries.', '[\"4\"]', '[\"168\"]', 49, 0, 94, '2024-07-29 06:40:50', 94, '2024-07-30 04:17:25'),
(10, 'DEC-II Memo for 3rd Allocation under the Pakistan Floods Appeal\r\nSave the Children has been awarded a further GBP 819,619 under the third allocation of DEC Pakistan Floods Appeal. This additional funding under Phase 2 will be used in the same target provinces, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh, to respond to the needs of communities affected by the 2022 floods and to extend the project until August 2024. Save the Children will engage a new local partner for Sindh as the activities under this phase will involve construction, which requires a partner with the relevant expertise and experience. The selection of the partner is in process as per Save the Children’s (SC) selection criteria. \r\nTwo outcomes have been added in this additional allocation of funds.\r\nOutcome 1: Flood affected children, women, and their families have access to integrated and quality health, nutrition and protection services.\r\nIn Sindh, Save the Children, together with partner People’s Primary Healthcare Initiative (PPHI) will continue providing integrated health and nutrition support through two static health facilities in Sindh for an additional three months  until May 2023 before phasing out. \r\nWhile in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), SC will shift focus to institutional capacity building along with rehabilitation of health facilities under the health department. The floods destroyed six basic health units in Swat district and the department awaits support to rehabilitate these units. SC will therefore identify and select two basic healthcare facilities, in consultation with the district health office, for rehabilitation. A needs assessment exercise will be conducted to determine the rehabilitation work in the facilities and both will be equipped with solar-powered electricity systems for uninterrupted power supply as part of the work. \r\nThe project will now reach a number of five health facilities (four in KP and one in Sindh) out of which two in KP was the initial target and one in Sindh was reported in the six monthly report. In addition to the three health facilities, SC under 3rd allocation is now proposing two more facilities in KP. \r\nSave the Children will also build the capacity of Primary Healthcare Management Committees (PCMCs). These committees are organised at the level of the healthcare facility to manage the facility. However, the committees have never received capacity building support and as such have little knowledge and information on their roles and responsibilities. Thus SC will train  a total of 10 members of the government notified PCMCs relating to the two proposed basic healthcare facilities under 3rd allocation. In addition, SC will conduct sixty health and hygiene sessions benefiting 1,200 persons in communities by training ten health activists as well as organising one international/national health day.\r\nOutcome 2:  Girls and boys have access to safe, uninterrupted and quality education and protection support.\r\nSave the Children will continue to rehabilitate schools affected by the floods, where twelve schools will be selected in KP after conducting a needs assessment. Furthermore, these schools will be be equipped with solar powered electricity systems for uninterrupted power supply, while contributing to the government’s objective of solarizing all schools in the province. \r\nIn twenty six schools (12 selected for rehabilitation in KP under 3rd allocation and 14 schools proposed in the 6 month report for rehabilitation in Sindh), Save the Children will organize and train twenty six Parent Teacher Councils (PTCs)( SMCs) and engage them in the preparation of school improvement plans. Education kits and learning kits will be provide to the schools and students. 64 teachers will attend training on Teachers in Crises Context (TiCC) and Child Friendly teaching methods (CFT). Twenty six child clubs will be organized and attend sessions on child protection and health and hygiene. \r\nThe education department organises annual enrolment campaigns in districts to enrol out-of-school children. Save the Children will support the government in organizing these campaigns in the vicinity of the intervention schools. This will include social mobilization campaigns in communities to convince parents to enrol their children, particularly girls, in schools.\r\nIn addition, SC will conduct medical screening exercise in intervention schools. The exercise will screen all enrolled children for minor disabilities such as vision and hearing issues. The identified children will be provided spectacles and hearing aid. Teachers will be oriented on disability inclusion. The sensitization of teachers on disability inclusion is essential as the government’s teachers professional development does not include disability inclusion.\r\nSC will also continue its focus on the safety and well-being of children in school environments and their surrounding catchment areas with the primary objective of preventing child abuse, exploitation, and neglect within these settings while strengthening child protection systems. This includes the development of prevention programs and early intervention mechanisms, and ensuring that children have access to child-friendly support services both in schools and their communities. The beneficiaries will be students in schools and the children residing in the catchment areas. Furthermore SC will collaborate with school administrations, parents, local authorities, and local governments to implement awareness campaigns, build the capacity of teachers and community members and establish monitoring and reporting mechanisms.\r\nActivities proposed under 3rd allocation and the previous targets will result in the following:\r\nOne model school will be constructed in Sindh and forty four schools will be rehabilitated (25 schools in KP and 19 in Sindh). 90 trainings.\r\nOutcome 3:  Flood affected children and their families have access to improved water and sanitation facilities\r\nWater and Sanitation will be integrated across health and education outcomes. For the Education outcome, SC and local partners will rehabilitate inclusive latrines and hand washing facilities 12 schools in Swat. Furthermore, the project will ensure that the rehabilitated latrines and handwashing facilities are properly maintained in 26 schools (12 planned for rehabilitation in KP and 14 additional schools proposed in the six monthly report earlier for rehabilitation in Sindh). \r\nFor Health outcome, SC will undertake WASH rehabilitation for two health facilities/BHUs of Swat (KP). This will include repair and maintenance of inclusive latrines, hand washing stations, and resuming water supply to the health facilities by undertaking necessary repair of water supply pipes/storage tanks. \r\nIn addition, nine water supply schemes (four in KP and five in Sindh) will be rehabilitated at the community level, whereby schemes will be selected in consultation with relevant government departments and local communities. Pre and post water quality testing will be conducted to ensure water is safe for drinking purpose and meets WHO quality parameters. \r\nOne hundred and seven hygiene promotion sessions (sixty six in KP and forty one in Sindh) will be conducted in fourteen schools and nine communities to ensure 2,675 people are made aware on how to prevent themselves from water borne diseases and use of consumable NFI items in Hygiene kits. SC will facilitate hygiene sessions with provision of 1,400 hygiene kits to all children in fourteen schools (700 in KP & 700 in Sindh) to orient them on the hand washing practices and ways to prevent from water borne diseases.\r\nActivities proposed under 3rd allocation and the previous targets will result in the following:\r\nTotal of 13,605 beneficiaries will benefit through a total of 17 water supply schemes (12 in KP and 5 in Sindh). 72 latrines (40 latrines in 20 schools and 8 latrines in 4 health facilities in KP and 24 latrines in 7 schools in Sindh) will rehabilitated benefitting 3,600 individuals (2,400 individuals in KP and 1,200 individuals in Sindh). 3,200 hygiene kits will be provided to school children (2,000 children in KP and 1,200 in Sindh). Hygiene awareness session will benefit 6,475 individuals (3,950 individuals in KP and 3,550 individuals in Sindh).   \r\nNEW Outcome 4:  Facilitate Secure Livelihoods via climate smart agricultural practices and livelihoods\r\nLivelihood Recovery Interventions (Capacity building + in-kind support)\r\nUnder this component specialized training (3 day) for 800 individuals (400 Sindh, 400 KP) in advanced agricultural practices, encompassing modern farming techniques, crop diversification, and sophisticated post-harvest management strategies. Similarly, a kitchen gardening initiative is designed to empower 600 women (400 KP, 200 Sindh) by equipping them with essential knowledge in food security, nutritional education, and practical gardening skills to cultivate nutritious food sources. Essential toolkits will be provided to all participants to facilitate efficient agricultural practices and improve farming methodologies. For KG training, Farmer Field School / Women Open Schools methodologies will be adopted. \r\nLivelihoods Recovery Interventions – (Cash Assistance + Capacity building) \r\nTo enhance the resilience of agricultural and livestock-dependent communities, 1475 households (1050 Sindh, 425 KP) will be supported through conditional cash grants complemented by training on good agricultural practices, and livestock management. For Agriculture livelihood support PKR 32069/HH cash assistance will be provided to 700 (425 Sindh, 275 KP) small famers for agriculture inputs - seeds, tools, land preparation and land reclamation as per seasonal calendar. One day capacity building training on smart agriculture practices will be organized for the target beneficiaries in collaboration with district agriculture department.\r\nSimilarly, for livestock support, 775 livestock dependent vulnerable (625 Sindh, 150 KP) HHs will be supported through provision of cash assistance (PRK 32,069 per HH) for livestock fodder/feed for two months, vaccination, deworming, repairing of animal shed etc. Furthermore, one day training sessions will be conducted with these beneficiaries in collaboration with district livestock department.\r\nAdditionally, the construction of raised bed platforms is proposed through cash for work in specific districts of Sindh, including Khairpur and Dadu, as a measure of emergency preparedness and proactive response to flooding scenarios. These elevated structures are designed to provide a safe space for livestock during emergencies, serving as evacuation and refuge points during floods. Beyond their immediate utility in crisis situations, these platforms will be engineered to facilitate rainwater harvesting during dry spells, enabling the collected water to be utilized for livestock hydration and agricultural purposes. This multifunctional infrastructure aims to fortify community resilience against climatic adversities, ensuring sustained agricultural productivity and livestock safety. Through the cash for work immediate source of income will be generated for the targeted communities, helping households meet their basic needs, such as food, healthcare, and education. In this regard, 4 structures will be formed in Khairpur and Dadu district of Sindh Province \r\nNEW Outcome 5:  Rehabilitate and develop community-based climate resilient infrastructure schemes and enhance disaster preparedness.\r\nThe reports of various government and non-government institutions / organizations concentrate on the number damaged large scale government-sponsored infrastructure projects/schemes. Community-based infrastructure schemes that are numerous and are of significance to people living in the remote parts of KP are usually missed out. These schemes, most of the time, do not appear in the government data and are not included in any of the government line agencies’ Annual Development Plans. At this critical point, local communities in Swat are looking for support in rehabilitating and developing these schemes again. According to assessment carried out by SRSP, a total of 109 infrastructure schemes developed by them in partnership with local communities in Swat district are either partially or completely damaged. These schemes include farm to market roads, suspension bridges, flood protection structures, water supply schemes, irrigation channels and water ponds constructions for agriculture. For reviving livelihoods and developing climate resilient communities and infrastructure, Save the Children will adopt a two-pronged approach. Firstly, SC will develop/rehabilitate four fully and partially damaged infrastructure schemes relating to irrigation channel/ water ponds construction for agriculture in target areas with the active support of local communities, benefitting 9,000 beneficiaries. Secondly, SC will enhance the ability of communities to respond effectively to natural disasters, where SC will adopt a community centric approach grounded in the principles of equity for marginalized groups/individuals and sustainability. 120 individuals through 6 trainings will benefit on Disaster Risk Reduction and support the creation of community disaster preparedness plans.', '[\"2\",\"4\"]', '[\"49\",\"100\",\"168\"]', 3, 0, 95, '2024-07-29 08:07:01', 96, '2024-08-02 12:41:42'),

It also promotes local leadership and ownership of the project’s goal, objectives, and activities, ensuring sustainability and increased action to address CEFM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Project Goal:</strong> Grassroots CSOs are supported to engage in and implement high-quality, gender-transformative programming and advocacy that contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of CEFM and increased support for women and girls who experience or are at risk of CEFM.</p><p><i><strong>Objective 1:</strong> Mobilize, support, and coordinate grassroots CSOs to prevent and respond to CEFM with synchronized and gender-transformative, community-based approaches.</i></p><p><i><strong>Objective 2:</strong> Increase coordination among CSOs, relevant government authorities, and other key stakeholders to strengthen local leadership and implementation of gender-transformative and effective policies, programs, and advocacy to prevent and respond to CEFM.</i></p><p>The above objectives will be achieved focusing on supporting, mobilizing and coordinating with local CSOs to respond to CEFM with gender-transformative and community-based approaches. On the other hand, increasing coordination among CSOs, Government authorities and other key stakeholders to implement effective policies and advocacy to prevent CEFM.&nbsp;</p><p>Each objective will be achieved through the implementation of a package of activities that contribute to the outcome and output indicators included in the log frame.</p><p>The project aims to strengthen grassroots civil society organizations’ (CSO’s) ability to prevent and respond to child, early, and forced marriage (CEFM) in Pakistan with community-based and high-quality, gender-transformative programming and advocacy. To contribute to this goal, the project will also support the broader ecosystem (e.g., stakeholders, institutions, networks, policies) and CSO’s leadership within it, to accelerate action to reduce the prevalence of CEFM and expand support for survivors and at-risk women and girls. The project will:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><i>Provide financial, organizational, and technical support for 25 local CSO sub-awardees in Pakistan that prevent and respond to CEFM in Naseerabad and Jaffarabad in Balochistan province and Jacobabad and Khairpur districts in Sindh province.</i></li><li><i>Support at least two (one in each province) CEFM-related CSO networks at the district and provincial levels through sub-awardee participation to enable all CSO members to enhance evidenced-based CEFM programming, coordination, resource sharing, and joint advocacy and synchronize efforts with national- and provincial-level CSO networks.</i></li><li><i>Strengthen at least two (one in each province) CEFM-related multistakeholder networks of grassroots CSOs, relevant government authorities, and other key stakeholders to promote collaboration on CEFM prevention and response; address harmful gender and social barriers within networks that stifle leadership of historically marginalized groups; engage in joint advocacy, align local through national policy and programming, and disseminate key learnings to support high-quality, gender-transformative programming to end CEFM.</i></li><li><i>Facilitate the leadership and meaningful participation of marginalized groups (based on gender, age, caste, ethnicity, disability, socio-economic status, religion) within CSOs sub-awardees and the leadership of these groups, along with youth- and women-led CSOs within CEFM-related networks.</i></li></ol><p><strong>Major activities under Project:</strong></p><ul><li>Refine GAP analysis research findings and recommendations with local CSOs and key stakeholders, and refresh CSO landscape analyses to ground project activities in context-specific evidence on CEFM&nbsp;</li><li>Launch the ‘Grassroots Action (GAC) Fund to End CEFM’, with country-specific selection criteria and select a diverse range of local CSO sub-awardees&nbsp;</li><li>Support CSO sub-awardees to complete Organizational Capacity Assessments and strengthening plans and engage in gender-transformative capacity strengthening&nbsp;</li><li>Provide financial, organizational, and technical support for local 25 CSO sub-awardees in Pakistan that prevent and respond to CEFM</li><li>Strengthen CSO CEFM-related networks and regular cross-learning among CSOs at the district and local level</li><li>Strengthen multistakeholder networks of CSOs, relevant government authorities, and other key stakeholders and coordinate joint forums on preventing and responding to CEFM</li><li>Conduct policy review and recommendations workshop with CEFM-related multistakeholder networks&nbsp;</li><li>Support local, joint advocacy and campaigns by CSOs, government authorities, and other key stakeholders on ending CEFM</li><li>Disseminate project learnings and evidence to improve provincial and district-level programming on CEFM prevention and response, In conjunction with CSO sub-awardees.</li><li>Baseline and Endline studies of the project.</li></ul>', '2024-05-23 09:58:51', '2024-05-23 09:58:51'),

Our community has faced severe consequences due to the 2022 flood, leading to the complete destruction of our homes and leaving us without proper shelter and adequate food. During this challenging time, we expected fair and impartial assistance to help us recover. However, it has come to our attention that TKF\'s aid distribution process in our village is marred by discrepancies. It appears that the organization is only considering individuals who contribute a share in 25,000 rupees, documenting their names for assistance. Additionally, a second instalment of 15,000 rupees is reportedly provided only to those who have contributed financially and are deemed favored by the organization. When TKF conducted an assessment in our area, they requested a financial contribution from our community. Unfortunately, due to our inability to comply, our names were allegedly excluded from the survey. Furthermore, while other children in the area received school bags, our children were overlooked, leaving them without this essential item. In light of these concerns, our community is deeply disappointed with the treatment we have received. We kindly request that TKF reconsider and revisit our village during the assessment phase. We believe that a fair and unbiased evaluation of our situation is crucial to ensure that all affected individuals, regardless of their financial capacity, receive the assistance they desperately need. \r\nIsmail Khan S/O Juma Khan \r\nAttah Ullah S/O Rehmatullah \r\nMuhammad Ramzan S/O Toor Khan \r\nAsad Ullah S/O Bachal Khan .', '2', 'Refereed to Datix.', 'FSL Assessment', '6', '27284', '3', 'Yes', NULL, 'Sami Ullah, Khan', 'Head Risk & Compliance', NULL, '2024-02-27', NULL, '2024-04-29', 'Partially Satisfied', NULL, NULL, 'Serious Compliant was reported to DATIX.
